# MothCam: Automated Photography of Nocturnal Lepidoptera for Urban Citizen Science

## Project

I aim to develop a low-cost, deployable automatic moth camera that uses computer vision and deep learning to monitor moth populations. This device will improve data collection on moth behavior, population trends, and seasonal changes, supporting more effective conservation efforts.

## Rationale

Moths are vital nocturnal pollinators and a key food source for many bird species, yet their populations are declining due to habitat loss, pesticides, light pollution, and climate change. Traditional monitoring methods are labor-intensive and limited, highlighting the need for automated solutions.

## More information

I plan to submit my project to my regional and then state science fair, MSEF. I made a project plan and proposal that goes into much deeper detail. You can read it [here](/Project%20plan.pdf).
